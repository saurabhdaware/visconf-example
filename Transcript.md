Hey There!                                 
| I am Saurabh, and today I am super excited to announce VisConf!!
|| A lot of times in meetups, I see talks on some amazing topics
| Sadly small meetups do not have resources to record and publish these talks
| However the world needs to see them
|| So randomly I had the idea of creating an animated version of these talks
| VisConf lets you generate an animated version of talk from transcript and slides
| All you have to do is upload transcript and slides.pdf and send Pull Request to main repository
|| Lets discuss this in details
